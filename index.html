                  <h4>Anthony Foxcroft</h4>
                  <p>Mum told me there are so many things she could and perhaps believes that
                  she should say today, but she also knows you’ve all heard her stories MANY
                  times before. So, she’s misguidedly trusted me to take you through the life of
                  her husband and our father, Norman Donald Foxcroft.</p>
                  <p>Born in Florida on the West Rand on the 12 th of August 1953, he would forever
                  attach some mythical significance to that date and insisted that, contrary to
                  popular belief, this was actually the first day of spring. Each year on his
                  birthday he would be up at dawn, walking around the garden in his dressing
                  gown, searching for the first blossom that would prove his theory. He ALWAYS
                  found one.</p>
                  <p>Dad’s birthday was both easy to shop for and frustratingly difficult to hide the
                  nature of his presents. He delighted in simple pleasures and knew there was a
                  good chance most of his presents would be zoo biscuits, biltong or smarties. It
                  never failed to bring a wry smile to his face having guessed that the odd
                  shaped box didn’t contain an exotic tool but the pair of socks he knew was
                  coming.</p>
                  <p>He inherited more than just his second name from his own father, a love of all
                  things mechanical and technological and an insatiable curiosity that drove him
                  to try to understand how the world worked. This amused his sisters as they
                  watched him disassemble everything on gran’s kitchen table to find out what
                  made it tick. He continued this habit throughout his life, and it was not
                  reserved for things that were old and broken. My mum understood that the
                  brand new Italian coffee machine we’d just purchased had to be taken apart
                  first before we could even consider using it.</p>
                  <p>Because of this he was an incredible teacher which he may not actually have
                  been aware of. He had a way of breaking down a problem and presenting it
                  you in small parts and in away that you felt you had discovered the solution
                  yourself. He would spend hours helping us perfect the techniques of tying
                  ropes and halters, joining a gliders wing or wiring trees to achieve perfect
                  bonsai. In later years he enjoyed his role as a grandfather too. Catherine’s
                  youthful candour brought that characteristic wry smile to his face. It is a great
                  pity that that she did not get to know him better.</p>
                  <p>He remembered his youth fondly as a time when he could fashion a pipe into a
                  canon for launching batteries out into the veld with his cousins, ride his
                  scrambler with friends and take up photography as a hobby.</p>

                  <p>He had a fascination with boats from an early age, joined the rowing team at
                  school and became a sea scout, which he affectionately called “puddle
                  pirates”. He would spend many hours happily sailing his small sailing boat
                  around the dam.</p>
                  <p>He joined the Post Office in 1973 as a junior electrical engineer and steadily
                  rose up the ranks in Telkom as it became known. He enjoyed a 40 year career
                  there until his retirement in 2013 where his colleagues spoke very highly of his
                  technical ability and people skills with which he managed his team.
                  Mum and dad were married in 1979 which led to a union which lasted 40
                  years. I think that a large part of the long success of their marriage was that he
                  learned very early on to resolve any problems by simply saying “Yes Jen.”
                  His spiritual home was always in the “Transvaal” and moved to Cape Town
                  somewhat begrudgingly to take up a promotion, although he eventually he
                  was fully Capetonian and complained about all the vaalies here at Christmas
                  time.</p>
                  <p>He always had a love of outdoor life and enjoyed camping, caravanning and
                  hiking. Easter time meant the annual family pilgrimage to a camp in the
                  Drakensberg until moving to Cape. Later on, his outdoor fix came from regular
                  trips to South Africa many and varied game reserves, most often with a
                  handful of the Jooste family as regular travelling partners. The planning
                  sessions for these trips began a year before the time and provided him many
                  hours of amusement while simultaneously causing him to pull out some of the
                  little hair he had left.</p>
                  <p>He always had a close relationship with many dogs in his life and had very little
                  regard for cats, although that was always accompanied by that wry smile. So it
                  was with some surprise that when a hungry stray kitten wandered in to our
                  garden that he would be the one to offer it some milk. That cat adopted him
                  on the spot and never left.</p>
                  <p>The phrase “Jack of all trades” comes to mind when describing his many
                  abilities but it would be unfair because he was actually a master of so many.
                  He was a bricklayer, carpenter, welder, electrician, plumber, motor mechanic,
                  computer programmer, project manager, beer brewer and olive pickler.
                  He did everything he ever could for his children, driving to PE in the middle of
                  the night to get 10 kids to a bowling tournament, converting the entire side
                  alley in to a bonsai tree experiment and using an unnecessarily industrial weed
                  eater as a hedge trimmer to keep the horse yard looking spick and span. He
                  was always concerned with our future, but able to allow each of us to find our
                  own path.</p>
                  <p>There have been many times where having driven mum to the brink of insanity
                  she would exclaim to me “you’re just like your dad!”. 10 year-old me took that
                  as the gravest insult but as the years went on I found that there is no escaping
                  that truth, I AM just like him, and it’s a badge I wear with honour.</p>

                  <h4>Gavin and Anne Foxcroft (read by Craig Vaughan)</h4>
                  <p>Just a few words. 
                  So sorry we have not been in contact for some time. 
                  Sadly, like most of us Foxcroft’s we have never been good about keeping contact. Such a pity.
                  Norman to me was simply a copy of Uncle Don as I remember him. First and foremost a thorough gentleman with a soft nature. Always willing to share knowledge to help others. I don’t recall ever seeing Norman cross. 
                  Rest well my friend, the pain is over. We will meet again.</p>

            <div class="well well-lg text-left">
                  <h4>Clive James and cousins (read by Craig Vaughan)</h4>

                  <p>Our big cousin Norman will always be the guy that led the run into The Mudbath. Even though it was filmed in the late ‘50s probably before I was born, I lived The Mudbath. We watched that 8mm home movie over and over along with the Charlie Chaplain show.</p>
                  <p>Norm was a sort of big brother/hero because he got to do the big boy things first ... he had the vast collection of comics piled up higher than our shoulders while we lay reading on the spirally dining room carpet. He had the small wooden saddle to strap onto the dachshund’s back so that King Rat could be raced around the back garden. He was in the senior sea scout leadership when I was on my first scout camp at Little Falls and it was comforting to know he was there. He and is friends told very Goon-like stories around the campfire and had us in stitches. Norm had the dabchick type yacht and took us out on the lake for a spin. He was the first real actual person I knew with a motorbike and took me for my first bike ride in the veld behind the house.</p>
                  <p>I went with him to Europe in ‘76 and it was with him - after a huge jug of sangria in Venice and thinking we were a bit pissed- that a huge earthquake struck the area. We heard a fleet of trucks rumbling up from below our feet and the sangria had made all the lights in the taverna swing. Til the trucks hit under our feet and the tables jumped. We sobered up very fast as the lights went out and the canals and lanes rocked in clay shock absorbers. Of course Norm said we needed to go back in the dark and pay our bill.</p>
                  <p>My sister Jen gave me an electric bike she’d won in a competition - Norm bought it from me for R800, exactly enough money for me to buy my first car. A Fiat 125 with an 8track deck.</p>
                  <p>I’m sad that we lost this good guy, big cuz, far too soon. Lots of love to you and the kids Jen. From me and all of the James gang. </p>
                  <p>Love<br/>
                  Clive</p>
